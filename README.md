## Lab 11

### Links and Resources:

- Random number generator from [w3 resource](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-math-exercise-4.php)

- The "goat vote" demo that we worked out as a class before this lab mirrored our assignment really clearly. I ended up having to refer back to the demo code often. But after completing lab 11, I feel more comfortable with dom manipulation and constructor functions.
